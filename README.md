# World Cup Automater
## 2018 Fifa World Cup Russia

Quick bit of example python to show how to get the json, find the matches your want (just group A at the moment in this example) and print out the data.

Of course...England will win so there is no point in the other teams turning up :D

Requires: python3-arrow 

usage: python3 wcup.py

The code should be self explanatory.


Based on the ace work made by [lsv](https://github.com/lsv/fifa-worldcup-2018)
